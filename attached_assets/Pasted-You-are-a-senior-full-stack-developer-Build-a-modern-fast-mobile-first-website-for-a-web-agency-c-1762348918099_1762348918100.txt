You are a senior full-stack developer. Build a modern, fast, mobile-first website for a web agency called **DigitalAgency4Us**. We build websites with **WordPress** OR **custom code (HTML/CSS/JS)**, and when we code custom sites we maintain the code in **Git repositories**. We also provide full-stack builds (frontend, backend, database) and can **host + maintain** for clients for an annual fee.

### Tech + Project Setup
- Use **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** (no CSS frameworks that require CDN). 
- Provide production-ready, accessible UI. 
- Create a simple **/api/contact** endpoint using **Express** in the same Replit project that sends emails via **EmailJS** (or leave a clearly marked function stub to integrate SMTP later). Validate inputs server-side and client-side.
- Organize code cleanly: `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/data`, `src/lib`, and an `express` server with `server/index.js`.
- Add a simple JSON-driven content layer (`src/data/*.json`) so text, services, pricing, portfolio, and testimonials can be edited without touching components.

### Brand & Style
- Brand name: **DigitalAgency4Us**
- Tagline: *“We build, host & scale websites that grow your business.”*
- Color palette: primary `#0EA5E9` (sky-500), dark `#0B1220`, light `#F1F5F9`.
- Typography: Inter or system UI. Rounded cards, soft shadows, generous spacing.
- Include a simple text logo and a favicon.

### Pages & Sections
1) **Home (/)**  
   - Hero with headline, subtext, CTAs: “Get a Quote”, “View Work”.

   - Services preview (cards).  
   - Portfolio preview (2 items).  
   - Testimonials carousel.  
   - Tech stack row (WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, MySQL/Postgres).

2) **Services (/services)**  
   - Two primary tracks:  
     a) **WordPress Sites** (themes, plugins, CMS, fast delivery)  
     b) **Custom-Code Sites** (HTML/CSS/JS; full stack with backend + database; repo maintenance)  
   - Also list: UX/UI, SEO basics, performance optimization, analytics, ongoing support.

3) **Portfolio (/portfolio)**  
   - Projects pulled from `src/data/portfolio.json`.  
   - Include these NOW:

       Short note: “Real estate site with clear property sections and strong CTAs.”  
   - Each card: title, description, link, badges (WordPress or Custom Code), and cover image placeholder.

4) **Pricing (/pricing)**  
   - Show one-time build packages (Starter, Business, Scale) with bullets for features.  
   - Add an **Annual Hosting & Maintenance Add-On** card that clearly states:  
     “If we take care of hosting and maintaining databases, we charge additionally per year.”  
   - Include a comparison table that distinguishes:  
     - WordPress Build (includes CMS setup)  
     - Custom-Code Build (includes Git repo maintenance)  
     - Optional Annual Add-On (hosting, SSL, backups, monitoring, minor updates, database maintenance).

5) **About (/about)**  
   - Our process: Discover → Design → Build → Launch → Maintain.  
   - Emphasize repository maintenance, code quality, and transparent handover.  
   - Small team vibe; quality > quantity.

6) **Contact (/contact)**  
   - Form fields: name, email, phone, company, project type (WordPress/Custom/Not sure), budget range, message.  
   - Honeypot + rate limiting; validate; submit to Express endpoint; success/error states.  
   - Also list email and WhatsApp placeholders.

### Testimonials (must include these)
- “Veluxe Interiors — owner is **Hemath Kumar Reddy**.” Short quote: *“DigitalAgency4Us delivered a clean, responsive site and handled everything end-to-end.”*
- “MS Properties — owner is **Ramesh Goud**.” Short quote: *“They set up our site, hosting, and maintenance—zero headaches.”*
Store in `src/data/testimonials.json` and render as a slider.

### Copy Points (work into sections)
- “We build complete systems: frontend, backend, and databases.”  
- “Custom-code projects are maintained in private Git repositories.”  
- “We also build on WordPress for speed and CMS flexibility.”  
- “Annual hosting + database maintenance available as an add-on.”  
- “Everything we ship is responsive, fast, and SEO-ready.”

### SEO & Performance

- `src/data/testimonials.json` (names + quotes above)  
- `src/data/pricing.json` (packages + annual add-on line items)

### Nice-to-Haves
- Small FAQ accordion on Pricing page (ownership of code, what’s included in annual add-on, migration policy).  
- Reusable Button, Card, Section, Container components.  
- 404 page.  
- Scroll animations with IntersectionObserver (no heavy libs).

### Deliverables
